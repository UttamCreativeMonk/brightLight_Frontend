          Inland Spousal and Common-Law Partner Sponsorship
        </h1>
        <p>
          Inland sponsorship enables Canadians and permanent residents to
          sponsor their spouse or common-law partner for permanent resident
          status when the couple is already living together in Canada. This
          comprehensive guide outlines the key components of Inland sponsorship,
          helping you determine if this spousal sponsorship category aligns with
          your needs.
        </p>

        <h2
          style={{
            marginTop: "50px",
          }}

        >
          <li>
            <strong> Eligibility: </strong>Canadians and permanent residents can
            sponsor their loved ones, provided they legally cohabit in Canada.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Temporary Status Requirement:</strong> The foreign spouse
            or common-law partner does not need to hold valid temporary status
            in Canada (e.g., as a worker, student, or visitor).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Continued Living and Working:</strong> During the Inland
            sponsorship application process, the sponsored person can continue
            living, working, or studying in Canada.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> PR Visa Approval:</strong> Both the Canadian citizen or
            permanent resident and the foreign national must be approved by
            Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for the
            sponsored person to receive a Canadian PR visa through Inland
            sponsorship.

        >
          <li>
            <strong>Open Work Permit (OWP):</strong> Applicants may qualify for

          <li>
            <strong> Economic and Emotional Relief:</strong> An OWP eases

            application process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Staying in Canada:</strong> Inland sponsorship applicants

        <h3>Remaining in Canada:</h3>
        <p>
          Inland sponsorship applicants are generally expected to stay in Canada
          during processing. If the spouse or common-law partner needs to travel
          outside the country, Outland sponsorship may be a better option.
        </p>

          style={{

          Current approval times for Inland spousal sponsorship applications are
          approximately 12-14 months. Quebec residents or those planning to
          settle in Quebec may experience up to 24 months.

          The Spousal Open Work Permit Pilot Program (OWPP) allows spouses or
          common-law partners to work in Canada while awaiting spousal
          sponsorship application outcomes. Applicants can apply for an open
          work permit any time after applying for permanent residence in the
          Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada (SCLPC) class. The open work
          permit is not job-specific and allows work for any Canadian employer.
          These permits are typically valid for two years or until the passport
          expiry date.
        </p>

            address as your sponsor.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applying for a Spousal or Partner Work Permit</h3>
        <p>
          New spousal or partner work permit applications can be submitted along
          with your sponsorship application. These applications may also be
          submitted concurrently with an application for permanent residence.
          Ensure you include the appropriate fees and send the application by
          mail or courier.
