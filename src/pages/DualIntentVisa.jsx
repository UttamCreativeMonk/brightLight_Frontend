            A Dual Intent Visa allows you to have two different reasons for
            visiting Canada. This means you can come to Canada temporarily with
            the option of considering permanent residence in the future or vice
            versa. Typically, these applications are made by individuals who
            already have a temporary resident visa and have either applied or
            are planning to apply for permanent resident status in Canada. This
            flexibility is what makes this visa type unique and called "Dual
            Intent."
          </p>
          <p>
            At <strong>Brightlight Immigration</strong>, we understand that
            demonstrating Dual Intent can be complex. With over 12 years of
            experience, we aim to simplify this process for you.

          <ul>
            <li>
              If you've applied for permanent residence through spousal
              sponsorship and wish to reunite with your spouse in Canada while
              waiting for your PR application, you can apply for a Dual Intent
              Visa to temporarily visit and live with your spouse in Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              If youâ€™ve submitted an Express Entry profile and are in the
              application process, you can apply for a Dual Intent Visa to
              temporarily visit Canada or apply for a work/study permit while
              your permanent residency application is in process. This allows
              you to stay in Canada and experience the country during your PR
              application review.

          <p>
            Dual Intent Visa for Outland Spouse: Navigating the waiting period
            during spousal sponsorship application processing can be challenging
            for newly married couples. These applications often take a
            considerable amount of time to process. However, there is an
            alternative: the Dual Intent Visitor Visa. In most cases, this visa
            is approved within 30 days and boasts a remarkable success rate of
            over 90%.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a spouse or partner can convincingly demonstrate that they will
            leave Canada at the end of their authorized stay, even if their
            permanent residence application is rejected, officers may issue a
            temporary resident visa (TRV).

        <section className={styles.eligibility} id="eligibility">
          <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
          <p>
            Immigration officers carefully review your application for temporary
            residence to ensure you're eligible to stay in Canada and that you
            have genuine intentions. They consider various factors that affect
            your ability to support yourself and your plans for the future. Here
            are some key considerations for dual intent applications:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How long do you intend to stay in Canada? Provide a specific
              timeframe.
            </li>
            <li>
              How will you support yourself financially during your stay in
              Canada? Share your sources of income, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              What connections do you have that will ensure your return to your
              home country after you visit Canada? Share concrete examples.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clearly express the reason for your visit to Canada. Elaborate on
              the specific circumstances surrounding your trip.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure the documents you submit with your visa application are
              genuine and accurate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide evidence of your past compliance with Canadian immigration
              regulations and the information provided in your biographic and
              biometric records.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your visa application is refused, what are your plans for
              returning to your home country? Outline a clear contingency plan.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Under the recent changes to family reunification policies,
            immigration officers will now consider additional factors when
            assessing applications.
          </p>
          <h3>In cases of Spousal and Partners:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Immigration officers will evaluate whether your sponsorship
              application has been approved.
            </li>
            <li>
              Immigration officers will assess the progress of your permanent
              residence application, including whether stage one has been
              approved.
            </li>
            <li>The office will check if you have received your AOR or not.</li>
            <li>
              Immigration officers will also assess the ties to your home
              country.
            </li>
            <li>
              What will your plans be for returning home in case your permanent
              residence application is denied?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>In the cases of Parents and Grandparents:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Immigration officers will consider whether your permanent
              residence applications are in progress.
            </li>
            <li>
              They will assess whether your primary intention is to visit Canada
              temporarily and not seek permanent residency.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              The visa officer is not satisfied that you will leave Canada at
              the end of your stay.
            </li>
            <li>
              The visa officer is not satisfied that you have strong ties to
              your home country.
            </li>
            <li>
              The visa officer is not satisfied with your purpose for traveling
              to Canada temporarily.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have previous visa refusals on record that were not justified
              in your current application.
