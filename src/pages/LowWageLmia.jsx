          <p>
            Low-wage/High-wage LMIAs are used by the employer to fill the
            immediate labor shortage in their business. Whether to apply for
            low-wage or high-wage LMIA, you must understand the following three
            key aspects related to wages in Canada.

            The National Occupational Classification is a database developed by
            the Government of Canada categorizing all types of possible
            occupations in the Canadian labor market according to their skill
            level.

          <p>
            Government of Canadaâ€™s official Job Bank website lists the
            prevailing median wage, for each NOC TEER Code, which is specific to
            the NOC code and location of work being offered by the Canadian
            employer. One of the most important LMIA requirements is to match
            this wage with what the employer will offer to their foreign worker.

            in April. This median hourly wage is called the

              The employer can apply for low-wage/high-wage LMIA to immediately

            <li>
              Even the employers whose incorporation is fairly new (less than
              one year in operation), can apply for one of these types of LMIA,
              provided they can justify that the business is actively providing
              goods or services and they can meet the financial obligation
              related to hiring and paying the foreign worker.
            </li>
            <li>
              The employer can hire anyone qualified for the job from anywhere
              in the world or within Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              The employer can apply for an unnamed LMIA and then add the name

            above, do not worry. With over a decade of experience, we specialize
            in previously refused cases. While we don't provide jobs for LMIA,

            obtained approvals for clients who had multiple previous refusals.
            We achieve this with a tailored approach to your specific case,
            addressing each concern that the officer has listed in previous
            refusals. We use case law and find similar cases to your
            circumstances that had positive results, and we use them as
            precedents in cases we work on. This is why we have a high success
            rate.
