          <h1>Family Reunification and Sponsorship</h1>
          <p>
            Canada is renowned for its welcoming spirit and commitment to
            diversity, making it a haven for immigrants looking for a better
            life. When it comes to family reunification, Canada has established
            a comprehensive program that allows Canadian citizens and permanent
            residents to bring their loved ones to the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Canada's Family Reunification Program is one of the three main
            pathways to permanent residency in Canada, alongside economic
            immigration and refugee protection. It allows Canadian citizens and
            permanent residents to sponsor certain relatives to immigrate to
            Canada as permanent residents.
