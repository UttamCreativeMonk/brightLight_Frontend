          <dt>Who can sponsor a dependent child?</dt>
          <dd>To be eligible to sponsor a dependent child, you must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. You must also meet the financial requirements, provide proof of legal custody of the child, and be able to prove that the child is your biological, adopted, or stepchild.</dd>

          <dt>What is the age limit for dependent children?</dt>
          <dd>A child is considered a dependent child if they are under the age of 22. However, there are some exceptions. Children who are 22 or older may still be eligible to be sponsored if they have depended on their parents for financial support since before they were 22 and they are unable to financially support themselves because of a physical or mental condition.</dd>

          <dd>To be eligible to sponsor a dependent child, you must have enough income to provide for the child's basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, and medical care. You must also show that you have the savings to support the child for at least three years after they arrive in Canada.</dd>

          <dt>What is the medical exam for dependent children?</dt>
          <dd>All sponsored children who are over the age of 15 are required to undergo a medical exam to assess their health. The exam will determine if the child has any medical conditions that may affect their ability to live in Canada.</dd>

          <dt>How long does the application process take?</dt>
          <dd>The processing time for a dependent child sponsorship application can vary depending on several factors. However, it typically takes between 12 and 18 months to process an application.</dd>
