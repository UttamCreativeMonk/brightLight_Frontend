            Canada's Express Entry system is not just a general immigration
            tool, but also a strategic resource for targeting specific sectors
            of the economy. Occasionally, Canada conducts Science, Technology,
            Engineering, and Math (STEM)-specific draws through the Express
            Entry system. These draws specifically target candidates who have
            work experience in eligible STEM occupations.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're part of the STEM workforce and are considering immigrating
            to Canada, these specialized draws could be a significant
            opportunity for you. Stay tuned for more updates on these
            STEM-specific Express Entry draws and make your move to Canada a
            successful one.

            First You Must Be Eligible with Express Entry
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before you can participate in a STEM-specific draw through Canada's
            Express Entry system, you need to be eligible. Here's how you can
            get started:
          </p>
          <ol style={{ marginLeft: "40px" }}>
            <li>
              Join the Express Entry Pool: The first step towards becoming a
              candidate for a STEM-specific draw is to get into the Express
              Entry pool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose Your Program: There are three programs you can be eligible
              for to join the Express Entry pool:
              <ul
                className={styles.subheadingLink}
                style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}
              >
                <li style={{ textAlign: "center", marginBottom: "30px" }}>
                  <button
                    
                    className={styles.button1}
                    onClick={() =>
                      (window.location.href = "/federal-skilled-worker-program")
                    }
                  >
                    Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSW)
                  </button>
                  This program is ideal for tech workers who have the necessary
                  work experience, education, and language ability.
                </li>
                <li style={{ textAlign: "center", marginBottom: "30px" }}>
                  <button
                    className={styles.button1}
                    onClick={() =>
                      (window.location.href = "canadian-experience-class")
                    }
                  >
                    Canadian Experience Class (CEC)
                  </button>
                  Similar to the FSW program, the CEC is also suitable for tech
                  workers who have gained Canadian work experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <button

                    }
                  >
                    Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)
                  </button>
                  If you're a trades worker, this program is designed for you.
                  It requires proof of relevant work experience, education, and
                  language proficiency.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Remember, each program has its own set of eligibility requirements.
            So, make sure to review these carefully and ensure you meet all the
            necessary criteria before applying.
          </p>
          <h2>Important things to keep in mind:</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSW) BACKLINK
            and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) BACKLINK - the two programs
            most relevant to tech workers - you&#39;ll need at least one year of
            continuous work experience in a &quot;skilled&quot; occupation.
            These occupations are classified under 0, 1, 2, and 3 of Canadaâ€™s
            Training Education Experience Responsibilities (TEER) categories.
          </p>
          <p>Here are a couple of important points to remember:</p>
          <ul style={{ marginLeft: "40px" }} className={styles.leftList}>
            <li>
              You can accumulate this work experience over two years in
              part-time roles, as long as it adds up to 1,560 hours, which is
              equivalent to one year of full-time work.
            </li>
            <li>
              The CEC program requires at least one year of skilled work
              experience in Canada. On the other hand, the FSW program doesn't
              require any Canadian work experience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The reason we&#39;re stressing that you need to be eligible for
            Express Entry is to make it clear that having six months of work
            experience in a STEM occupation isn&#39;t enough to qualify for
            Express Entry. You need to meet the work experience requirements for
            at least one of the programs first. If you have one year of work
            experience in an eligible STEM occupation and meet the other
            requirements of the CEC or the FSW, then you may be invited in a
            STEM-specific draw.
