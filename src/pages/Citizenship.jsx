              <li>
                You have to pass a citizenship test. This test is made to assess

                government.
              </li>

            <h2>Reasons for refusal of Canadian Citizenship:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Non-compliance with residency requirements: To be eligible for
                Canadian citizenship, you must have lived in Canada for at least
                1,095 days (3 years) during the five years before applying. You
                must also have maintained your permanent resident status
                throughout this time. If you have not met these residency
                requirements, your application may be refused.
              </li>
              <li>
                Failure to pass the citizenship test: The citizenship test
                assesses your knowledge of Canadian history, geography, values,
                and government. You must achieve a score of 75% or higher to
                pass the test. If you do not pass the test, you will be required
                to retake it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your Inability to Show Language Proficiency: To be eligible for
                Canadian citizenship, you must showcase your proficiency in
                either English or French. You can do this by passing a language
                test. If you do not pass the language test, you may be required
                to take additional language classes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Misrepresentation or fraud: If you have misrepresented or
                falsified any information on your citizenship application, or if
                you have provided false or misleading information to a Canadian
                immigration officer, your application may be refused.
              </li>
              <li>
                Criminal record: If you have a criminal record, it may affect
                your eligibility for Canadian citizenship. In some cases, a
                criminal record may be a bar to citizenship.
              </li>
              <li>
                Security concerns: If there are any security concerns about your
                application, your application may be refused. This could include
                concerns about your involvement in organized crime, terrorism,
                or other criminal activities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Failure to attend a citizenship ceremony: If you are invited to
                a citizenship ceremony, you must attend to take the Oath of
                Citizenship. If you do not attend the ceremony, your application
                may be refused.

              If you have received a refusal for any of the reasons mentioned
              above, do not worry. With over a decade of experience, we
              specialize in previously refused cases. We have got approvals for
              clients who had multiple previous refusals. We achieve this with a
              tailored approach to your specific case, addressing each concern
              that the officer has listed in previous refusals. We use case law
              and find similar cases to your circumstances that had positive
              results, and we use them as precedents in cases we work on. This
              is why we have a high success rate.
